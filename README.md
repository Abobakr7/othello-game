# Othello Game with Python Tkinter

This project is a Python implementation of the classic board game Othello using the Tkinter GUI library. It supports two gameplay modes: player vs. player (1vs1) and player vs. computer (1 vs. computer), with the computer's difficulty adjustable between easy, medium, and hard levels.

## Features

-   **1vs1 Mode**: Play against another human player.
-   **1 vs. Computer Mode**: Play against an AI with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
-   **Graphical User Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
-   **Move Validation**: Ensures all moves adhere to Othello rules.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   **Model**: Contains files related to the game board and its logic.

    -   `Board.py`: Responsible for creating and managing the game board.

-   **Controller**: Manages the game logic and AI.

    -   `Othello.py`: Handles the core game logic.
    -   `AI.py`: Implements the AI agent for playing against a human.

-   **View**: Contains the graphical user interface components.

    -   `GameGUI.py`: Responsible for building and managing the gameâ€™s GUI.

-   **Utils**: Provides utility functions and constants.

    -   `Constants.py`: Contains constant variables used throughout the project.

-   **assets**: contains images that would be used in the game
